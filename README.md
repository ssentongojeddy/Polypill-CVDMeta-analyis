Efficacy of Different Polypill Combinations for Primary and Secondary Cardiovascular Disease Prevention: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

DOI: 10.3389/fcvm.2025.1558579
This meta-analysis assesses the efficacy of different fixed-dose polypill combinations in reducing cardiovascular outcomes including major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), cardiovascular death, and all-cause mortality.

Key Findings

Polypill use reduces MACE by 22%
(RR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.63â€“0.97)
Cardiovascular mortality reduced by 25%
(RR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.63â€“0.89)
All-cause mortality reduced by 12%
(RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79â€“0.98)
Combinations with high/moderate-intensity statins, aspirin, and diuretics were most effective.
The greatest MACE benefit was observed in studies conducted in Asia (RR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.54â€“0.74).
Data were derived from 30 studies, representing 35,833 participants across six continents.
